# CGL - Chris enGine OpenGl
---
Current state of this library is heavily WIP, but it works. For me at least.

## Build
To build this library, go under Debug dir, and do the following:

```bash
$ make all
```

If you don't want to build it yourself, you can download already build version of libCGL.a from release.
(Currently build only for LinuxGCC).

You will get then a `libCGL.a` static library file which you can use in your project.
In the `include` are stored symlinks to all `src/*.h` header files.

But using this library might be quite difficult as of now, because there is no documentation. (Yes, there might be some day)
